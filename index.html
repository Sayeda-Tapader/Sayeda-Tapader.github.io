    <h3>Java Game</h3>
    <p>
      My game is a platform game that I developed in my first year studying Computer
      Science at City, University of London. It leverages a simple didactic Physics
      Library that wraps around JBox2D/Box2D, which allows programmers to create
      and simulate 2D world populated by bodies with diverse shapes and appearances,
      create soundscapes and specify custom keyboard and mouse interactions.
      The game demonstrates the main character, the player navigate around, while
      staying far from the enemy and collecting coins.
      The character can jump up by pressing J and go left and right by pressing
      L and R, respectively.

        
        This is my 2D platform game I have developed over this term during my first year studying Computer Science here at City, University of London. 
        The objects simulate real-world physics from the City Physics Engine we were provided by the university
